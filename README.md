<p> MuzakMaker is a responsive website that is dedicated to displaying a curation of the soothing sounds of Jazz music.This website was completed as a class assignment at Arizona State University. This is the <a href= "https://thiggin7.github.io/streamingmedia/">link</a> to my website.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>This website consists of three navigation links that, when clicked, automatically scolls the page to the specified section of the webpage. The first section, TRENDING SONGS, consists of a horizontal scrollbar in which the user can scroll to see all trending songs and, since these songs have an audio feature, users are also able to listen to the song.</p>

<p>The second section and third section, YOUR PLAYLISTS and CURATED PLAYLIST, respectively provide the title and a short description of each playlist. They also feature horizontal scrollbars.</p>
 
 <p>Since this website was solely a class assignment to teach us students how to create a responsive website and implement audio features, the profile picture does not lead to a signin page, the playlist and curated playlist, when clicked do not provide further features and the 'more trending' button does not link to another page.</p>
